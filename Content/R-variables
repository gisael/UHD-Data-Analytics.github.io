# Understanding Variables in R

## What are variables and why we need them?

Variables in computer programming are labels we use to store value (information) for later use. We use variables because we will not always remember the value we want to use in our program, also, a familiar name (for a variable) can help us remember what value we need to use in our program.

## Let's do some work

Let's say we are calculating the area of rectangle

![Rectangle image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vej-rmSfo_1rrkxwbtTtP16wNOfpIKhw/view?usp=sharing)

The formula for the area of a rectangle is _length_ times _width_ we can make use of variables to store the values of the rectangle in order to get the area.

The variable "L" will store value of length and "W" the with. We will use letter "A" to store the area.

i.e. 

``` R
L <- 5
W <- 2
A = L * Y
A
[1] 10
```

If we can to do the calculation of the area for another rectanble with different values we do not have to re-write the code but just changes values for **L** & **W** and re-run the code.

i.e.

``` R
L <- 8
W <- 5
A
[1] 40
```

## Type of data a variable can store

Variables do not only store numerical values. They can store any type of data supported by the languege we use. Following are the most basic data types in R:

* Decimal values like 1.2 are called numerics.
* Natural numbers like 5 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
* Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
* Text (or string) values are called characters.

Note: be advise that to assign text to a variable we must put the text value within quotation marks.

i.e.

``` R
A <- "Hello World!"
A
[1] "Hello World!" 
```

If you have a variable but do not know what type of data it is storing you can always make use of class() function, as the following code shows.

``` R
number <- 5
text <- "Hello!"
class(number)
[1] "numeric"
class(text)
[1] "character"
```
